You will create a small Node, Express, and MongoDB server application. The topic and content of this application is entirely up to you; be creative!
Your work will be graded according to the technical requirements listed in the following section. Creativity and effort always work in your favor, so feel free to go beyond the scope of the listed requirements if you have the time.
Keep things simple. Like most projects you will encounter, you should finish the absolute minimum requirements first, and then add additional features and complexity if you have the time to do so. This will also help you understand what you can get done in a specific allotment of time if you were to be asked to do something similar in the future.
Once you have an idea in mind, briefly discuss it with your instructors to determine if it is appropriate for the amount of time you have been given.
Since topic and content are secondary to functionality for this assessment, we have included some resources below for free content that you can use to populate your application. Once you have gotten your functionality in place, you can return and fill in the content with something interesting.
